# SFS-Tanuku-Website
 Comprehensive repository for a School Website project, featuring dynamic front-end development with React.js, powerful back-end functionalities using Python (Flask) and MongoDB, API integration, responsive design, intuitive content management, version control with GitHub

# Introduction
Our school website backend is built with Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. It handles data processing, authentication, and serves as the API to communicate with the frontend.

**I encourage and welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the school website backend. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or suggesting enhancements, your contributions are valuable here.**

# Getting Started
To get started with the school website backend repository, follow the steps below.

# Cloning the Repository
First, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. To do this, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

**git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-website-backend.git**


# Installing Requirements
Before running the backend locally, make sure you have the necessary requirements installed on your machine.

Python - version 3.6 or higher.
Setting Up the Environment
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the requirements, follow these steps to set up the environment and run the backend:

Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

**cd school-website-backend**
I recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

**On Windows**
**python -m venv venv**
**venv\Scripts\activate**

**On macOS and Linux**
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the project dependencies:
**pip install -r requirements.txt**
Copy the example environment file and update the necessary configurations: (contact me to get .env file)
**cp .env.example .env**
Update the .env file with your database credentials and other configurations.
Run database migrations:
**flask db upgrade**
Build and run the backend:
**flask run**
The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
This should be enough to start the server
